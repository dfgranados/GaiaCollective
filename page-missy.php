		<div class="col-sm-8">Missy is a mystic, dreamer, soul searcher, animal dancer, wonder weaver, wild spirit. She is a facilitator of transformation, Yoga being that star of that role. She nurtures, inspires, and envisions. She is a vessel that wants to heal the people from the inside out, through the creatures, through the land, uniting heaven and earth in their hearts. She wants to create magic and bring people back to their wild selves. Wild does not mean crazy and out of control. It means living naturally and holistically, rooted in ancient tradition but growing in the modern world. Nature is not small, she does not play small. She is big, powerful, potent and full of force...and so are you. Missy has come to believe in the healing power of her own hands and she wants the people, too, to feel this enchantment. The enchantment to heal oneself, through oneself. To shine. Every Divine Day.</div>
