		<div class="col-sm-8">Paula is a dedicated yogi, focused and committed to illuminating the beauty in our human experience through soulful practice. She cares deeply about offering a space for individuals to drop in and connect to their collective, sacred meaning. Paula spreads this message as an instructor of yoga, jewelry maker, and artist. By sharing her personal yoga practice, Paula aims to inspire others to step into the magic of their being and begin to own their destiny. She firmly believes that movement, meditation, and creation of that which sets your heart on fire, is a recipe for self realization -- the fabric of universal compassion. As a member and co-founder of GAIA Collective, Paula hopes to be a part of ever-growing community of light workers, dream weavers, and spirit seekers, planting peace across the globe. Together, we have the power to charge the world with positive intention, magnified through the frequencies of our Mother Earth, Gaia. </div>
