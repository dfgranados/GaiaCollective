		GAIA COLLECTIVE is a pack of spirit seekers, creatively
weaving a golden tapestry of healing jewelry, holistic products,
and events. We aim to sow widespread seeds of spritiuality
through growing community. On this platform we share our art
& jewelry, as well as the nectars and herbal medicine of our
Mother Earth, <i>Gaia</i>. This organization exists to honor Gaia
through creative expression & community.
 <br>We are a coalition between people who want to see Mother
Earth blossom and thrive.
 <br><i>Our purpose</i> is to create a metaphysical marketplace focused on
awakening one another as brothers and sisters of the stars.
 <br><i>Our hope</i> is that GAIA COLLECTIVE will serve as a platform to
water our roots and drink in the light.
