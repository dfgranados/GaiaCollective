After graduating from Texas Christian University in 2013 with a BFA in Printmaking and Arts Administration, Evan Rottet moved to Houston, TX to further her exploration and involvement in the arts. She co-founded GAIA Collective; a Holistic Healing Artist Coalition, worked as a commissioned and exhibited artist and was published in the arts magazine Blue Canvas. 
Over time and by means of her curiosity in subliminal subjects, Rottet began to believe making and surveying art as a means of therapy. A release of subconscious turmoil or unrest. She found a passion for pushing the limits of traditional methods of printmaking and the psychological benefits of this approach. As an artist who has come to this realization, Rottet makes work that provokes the viewer to consider more than what was going on in the mind of the artist and incites a deeper understanding of the viewer itself. Her artwork challenges traditional techniques and escapes stereotypes of editions, two dimensional, matted and framed works. She encourages investigation into this liberating method of printmaking and plans to pursue inspiring others through Art Therapy.
